# AWS Monitorization (Developer Operations Assignment)
This was my first Assignment in Developer Operations and it was completed in my 3rd year. The overall objective of this Assignment is to automate using Python 3 the process of creating, launching and monitoring a public-facing web server in the Amazon cloud. The web
server will run on an EC2 instance and display some static content that is stored in S3. The
program that does this must be called run_newwebserver.py and you can simply download this repository and running the 'run_newwebserver.py'
script. To run this program, you must have boto installed and your keys properly configured in your .boto file in the home folder.

# Important Notes:
- This program already consists of a private key hardcoded throughout the entirely script already which you will find in the repository under 'RSolomon1912'.pem file which means that you don't need to worry about creating your own key.
